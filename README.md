A repository to send over the code I wrote at home to the PC in 42 Wolfsburg
I am lazy and wrote the whole project at home, so I could escape spending time with my family at christmas

The project requires us to write a programm that gives out a set of instructions
Theese instructions will allow you to sort a list given to the programm

So for the input
2, 1, 3
it would return
sa
which means swapping the first two numbers, which would make the lsit 1, 2, 3
